    I would like all people who drop by here to insert there own ideas and improvements. Just save a revision before you start editing.

Important features:
    Sentences
    Nouns
    And
    Pronouns
    Verbs
    Structs
    
        Sentences

ETL statements are organized into 'sentences'. Instead of a semicolon on the end of a statement, there is a period.
    display the string "Hello, World!".
    
        NOUNS
        
A noun in ETL is just another name for a variable. However, like a noun in english, it can be refered to with a pronoun.
    create number x.
Nouns can be set to different values within their type.
    set x to 5.
        x = 5
    set x to x - 1.
        x = 4
Temporary nouns can also be created using the keyword 'the'.
    if x == the number 7 then
        display "Chocolate!".
        [Devyn Cairns] Maybe try to experiment with things like "if x is equal to the number 7 then" or "if x is the number 7 then", more English-like that way and not that much harder :)

However, the 'the' keyword doesn't need to be used. Use whichever looks and feels nicer to you!
    if x == 7 then ... .

        AND

The keyword 'and' is used to create groups. It's hard to explain, so some examples...
    create number x and number y.
    [Devyn Cairns] How about "create numbers x and y"
This creates two variables, like 'x,y = 0' in Ruby.
    create number x and set it to 5.
This links together two sentences, like in english. It runs both statements. It is the same as: create number x. set it to 5.
    create number x and number y and set them to 4 and 5.
The pronoun group (more on this later) 'them' is created, and 'set' is called on each item, assigning each value respectively. Same as:
    create number x. create number y. set x to 4. set y to 5.


        PRONOUNS
        
Pronouns are just like in the english language, kinda...
    create number x and set it to 3.
It is always an usable pronoun refering to the last referenced noun. However, if you have:
    create number x and number y.
It still refers to the last referenced noun, that is, y. However, in this situation, the pronoun group 'them' is called.
    create number x and number y and set them to 5 and 6.
What if you had a custom struct type and wanted to set a variable in the struct?
    create player x and set its position to [5, 5].
    create player x and player y and se their position to [5, 5] and [7, 5].
What if x and y were different structs?
    create player x and vector y. set x's position to [5, 5] and set y's xcoordinate to [7, 5].
    LIST OF PRONOUNS
        it    its
        them    their


        VERBS

Verbs are like functions/methods in other programming languages. They can be used on a group, or on single arguments. Create is an example of a verb.
    create verb 'addtwo to [number x]' and set it to
        return x +2
    create number anum and set it to 3.
    set anum to the result of [addtwo to anum]. # <--- NEED HELP WITH THIS SYNTAX!
        [Devyn Cairns] How's that? And I suppose you could make "the result of" optional.

        STRUCTS
        
Structs are a collection of verbs and nouns.
    create struct player that contains
        the number position which is set by default to [0,0],
        the string name.
    create player x and set its position to [5, 4]. set its name to "Bob".
        [Devyn Cairns] That looks much cleaner.
