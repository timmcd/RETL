This will hopefully become a fun little english-like language. We hope to write it in Ruby.

Running
----------------------------------

First, you should compile the parser. You don't have to, but it is recommended for speed.

    tt etl/grammar.tt

The interpreter is still being worked on, but you can try out the etl-parsetree tool.

Run the Ruby script, type a line of code and press ENTER. You will get a pretty long syntax tree. If it didn't parse, it will just print "nil".

Recent Activity
----------------------------------

Simple Compiler:

  Input is transformed into a simple list-tree structure. Run bin/etl-compiletree and see the output. (requires ANSI-capable terminal)

Works in Progress
----------------------------------

Verb definitions:
    verb print takes < +list[string] args >:
      call "write", [cat +args].
    ;;

Struct definitions:
    struct sport contains:
      textile description,
      text    object
    ;;

Blocks & Closures:
    create the server Google as [connect-to "www.google.com"].
    run-at [time "3:00 PM"], { print "Closures FTW". }
    run-at [time "3:01 PM"]:
      print "Blocks FTW".
      ping Google and if {? it}, {print "Google OK"}. -- ping google.com
    ;;

Compiled format (simple parsing format):
    live long and prosper. run-at the death-time, { print "Goodbye!". }.

    <<<(verb:"live") (noun:"long")> <(verb:"prosper")>> <<(verb:"run-at") (noun:"the-death-time") (block:<<<(verb:"print") "Goodbye!">>>)>>>

    -- and gzipped with Zlib.

Simple Interpreter:
    .. (404) specification not found :D
