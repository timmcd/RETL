This will hopefully become a fun little english-like language. We hope to write it in Ruby.

Running
----------------------------------

First, you should compile the parser. You don't have to, but it is recommended for speed.

    tt etl/grammar.tt

The interpreter is still being worked on, but you can try out the etl-parsetree tool.

Run the Ruby script, type a line of code and press ENTER. You will get a pretty long syntax tree. If it didn't parse, it will just print "nil".
